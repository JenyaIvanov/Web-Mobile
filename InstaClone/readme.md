# Instagram Clone
This project was constructed for educational purposes. I have learned many and greatly from it. In its current form this is not more than a fancy web-page and I have no intentions of developing any back-end to it (although I originally planned to).

It was created by me using Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS and Javascript, as an exam practice.
